## Project Description:

The objective of this project is to predict the points scored by a sports team in the NBA using polynomial regression. The dataset used in this project includes various attributes such as team name, points scored, average number of weightlifting sessions, average number of yoga sessions, average number of laps run per practice, water intake, and number of players absent for sessions.


## Execution Instructions for Modular Code:
* Option 1: Upload on Colab
    * Sign in to your Google account.
    * Upload the notebook in your Google Drive and open it with Google Colab.
    * Install libaries with the pip statements mentioned in the notebook
    * Restart Google Colab - Restarting the runtime in Google Colab after installing specific libraries is necessary because it reloads the Python environment and updates the PATH variable, which enables the system to detect the newly installed libraries. This ensures that the installed libraries are fully integrated with the Python environment and can be imported and used in subsequent code cells. Without restarting the runtime, the newly installed libraries may not be detected, resulting in import errors or other unexpected behavior.
    * Run the rest of the codes.
* Option 2: Run the notebook locally using the pip statements given in the notebook.


## Execution Instructions for Modular Code:

* Create a virtual environment and install the the required libraries using the command pip install -r requirements.txt
* To run the modular code run Engine.py file. 
* You can chnage the degree of polynomial as per the requirement. 
* Tested on Python 3.8.10
